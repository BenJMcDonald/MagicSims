General refactoring (make Deck efficient)

Current: add green and blue mana

casting cost should be an object of some sort
make a generic Mana object that represents multiple colors
and define <, -, + on it

Cards should overrite a virtual cast function

'damage' etc as it is on cards at the moment should be replaced
by somehow organized "AI hints"- The AI should be able to get
qualitative characteristics about the card through this.
